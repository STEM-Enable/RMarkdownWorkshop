## Using ChromeVox

### Warning!

Learning to use a screenreader properly is well outside the scope of this workshop but having a basic understanding of how a screenreader can interact with a webpage is helpful. We will use a restricted mode of the ChromeVox screenreader which can read Word equations. Please also note that students will **certainly** have a screenreader more suited to education and employment than ChromeVox and that no student should be asked to change or acquire a skillset in a new screenreader without very good reason and plenty of advance notice. 

Please also note that these are instructions are not intended to teach you how to use a screenreader and they are not suitable for someone who usually uses a screenreader. These instructions exist solely to aid lecturers or teaching fellows in understanding how the structure of a webpage is used by a screenreader.

## What to do to have a go

To use ChromeVox to read mathematical text correctly you **must** use the keyboard, not the mouse. Mathematics will be read incorrectly if the mouse is used.

1. Enable the ChromeVox addon. Open the webpage you want to explore with Chrome.
2. ChromeVox will start if it is enabled. 
   * To stop ChromeVox from finishing the current output press **Ctrl**
   * When you have finished using ChromeVox you will want to disable it. It is possible to switch it off but to leave it enabled but this is beyond the scope of this introduction. 
3. ChromeVox has a mode called sticky mode. We are only going to use this mode as it is easy for an untrained user. You cannot fill in forms or edit when in this mode. 
   * To get in or out of scan mode press **Insert** twice on Windows or Linux or **left Command key** twice on Mac OS
   * More information at <http://www.chromevox.com/keyboard_shortcuts.html> 
4. Try not to use the mouse! Once in sticky mode use the below commands to explore the page. Try to move through the document in different ways to 'scan' it. Try to read the equations.

| Key press   	  | What will happen?	       	       	     	      	|
| --------------- |-----------------------------------------------------|
| Enter		  | Activate current item				|
| Tab		  | Jump to next focusable item				|
| Shift + Tab	  | Jump to previous focusable item			|
| Down/Up	  | Navigate forwards/backwards		   		|
| Right/Left	  | Navigate forwards/backwards at a more detailed level|
| Backslash	  | Enter table or equation exploration			|
| Esc		  | Exit table or equation exploration			|
| N		  | Next (follow by any of the below type commands)	|    				     		|
| P		  | Previous (follow by any of the below type commands)	|
| H		  | Heading  	     	       	   	      		|
| n in {1,..,9}	  | Heading at level n					|
| L		  | Link						|
| T		  | Table						|
| O		  | List						|
| I		  | List item						|

### Example of ChromeVox reading maths

## Read&Write addon to Chrome

It is also possible to use the [TextHelp Read&Write](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readwrite-for-google-chro/inoeonmfapjbbkmdafoankkfajkcphgd) addon to Chrome to read mathematical content. It is easier to use to test content as it is used with a mouse and you simply hover over text. The speech functionality remains free after the end of the trial period. However, this addon will only work on **live** webpages and so we are not able to use it to test output without uploading it somewhere. If one is intending to distribute pages to students via a virtual learning environment then upload to this environment for testing may be preferable.
