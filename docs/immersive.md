# Using Word 365 Learning Tools (Immersive) for basic tests

If you have access to Word 365 via a (non-mobile) browser you can do a basic test of accessibility of mathematics in the output Word document using the immersive learning tools. Any maths that is not appropriately read aloud is not accessible.

Once you have opened the document in Office 365 you can access immersive learning tools by:
1. In the ribbon click on **View**
2. Click on navigation to open the navigation pane. This will show the heading structure of the document. 
3. Click on Learning Tools (Immersive)
4. Increase the text size, change the colours etc. and have a look at the result.
5. Put the cursor in the document and click on read aloud and/or the play button (depends on version).
