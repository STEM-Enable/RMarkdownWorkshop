# Technical requirements for the workshop

* You will need a Windows, Linux or Mac laptop with recent versions of R, R Studio and LaTeX already installed.
* You will also need [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) though this can be installed on the day provided you have administrative permissions.
* It will be helpful if you have permissions to install R and LaTeX packages on the fly but not completely necessary.
* For testing you may wish to have access to:
  * [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) with addons [Read&Write (free version)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readwrite-for-google-chro/inoeonmfapjbbkmdafoankkfajkcphgd) and [ChromeVox Classic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox-classic-extensi/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn)
  * An [Office 365 account](https://www.office.com/) (to be used in the browser)
